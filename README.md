## Week 1

### Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks

Pro| Contra
------------ | -------------
__It's a tool to work faster and to avoid repeating yourself.__ Would a construction worker use his hands instead of a hammer? The tool is made to help you work more efficient and focus on the important parts. [source](https://blog.hellojs.org/javascript-frameworks-why-and-when-to-use-them-43af33d0608d) | __We will lack true understanding.__ While it makes the work easier, we won't really understand how and why something works. Like pushing a button on a phone to make a picture nowadays. 
__You will write code neatly and so will your team.__  All popular frameworks follow the best of industry standards and promote healthy engineering practices. You and your team will write code that is neat and correct. [source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-JavaScript-frameworks) | __Frameworks are made for massess.__ The specific solutions you need could be a fraction of the entire framework or not even be included. 
__Less maintenance.__ The community behind the framework will take care of bugs fixes and enhancements. [source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-JavaScript-frameworks) | __Frameworks aren't future-proof.__ The framework may not be around for the life of your project. Rewriting it in another framework would be the only solution.
__You write less code.__ Also very efficient and makes for a smaller file. | __Disadvantage the performance__ Framework utilities do a lot of processing to make it work for all possible ports. 
__Use the work of others.__ A lot of problems are already solved by people with more experience en knowledge than you. Frameworks are a way of learning from them. | __Takes away innovation and challenge.__ For some people, frameworks will reduce the fun they would have in coding. Everything is simple and has shortcuts now.

### Advantages and disadvantages of client-side single page web apps

Pro| Contra
------------ | -------------
__Straightforward pages for a clear prupose.__ One-page navigation, of course, is more straightforward than a larger site for sites which serve a single purpose. If your goal is to tell a story, single-page sites are a natural choice for visual narratives. | __Content needs to be organized.__ You can't fit a ton of content into a single-page web app. Not being able to find anything and seeing irrelevant content would be annoying.
__Scrolling is easier than clicking.__ If a user begins to scroll, then you may find them more likely to keep scrolling than to stop and click a link. You'll keep users interested for longer. | __Search engines don't like it.__ Search engines search for relevant content. When your page has all the content your website has to offer, the relevant keywords will be ondergesneeuwd. 

### Best practices
- Don't pollute the global scope, use objects instead.
- "use strict" to find errors faster.
